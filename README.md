# Practical Deep Learning Sprint Series
 
This event will be a guided sprint where you’ll attempt to solve [an assignment](./Assignment) covering the fundamentals of **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** and completing a basic code implementation of these concepts. A basic knowledge of **Python** is required since the primary aim of this session is to understand theory via implementation. It would be helpful if you go through some of the resources shared below, however that’s not a hard requirement. We’ll be helping you out wherever you get stuck.

The end goal will be to merge your implementations into this repository inside the [submissions](./submissions/) folder. If you’re not familiar with git don’t worry, we’ll guide you through it, however it would be great if you have your systems already set up.

## Steps 

- Download and setup Git (Resources shared below). Most MacOS and Linux machines come preinstalled with Git. 
- Fork this repo on Github and clone the forked repo on your local machine. 
- Attempt the assignment uploaded in the [Assignment](./Assignment) folder for the respective sprint date on Google Colab.
- Download the `.ipynb` file from Colab and save it in the [submissions](./submissions/) folder after renaming it as `<your-name-enrolment-no.>.ipynb`.
- Commit the changes that you have made using Git. Push the changes to your forked repo.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) to the original repository and wait for it to be merged.

You can try to complete the above steps as much as you can on your own before the sprint itself, although don't worry if you get stuck, the aim of the sprint itself would be to help you get through the implementation by the end of it.
