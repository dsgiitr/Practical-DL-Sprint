# Practical Deep Learning Sprint Series
 
This event will be a guided sprint where you’ll attempt to solve [an assignment](./Assignment.md) covering the fundamentals of **Computer Vision**. A basic knowledge of **Python** is required since the primary aim of this session is to understand theory via implementation. It would be helpful if you go through some of the resources shared below, however that’s not a hard requirement. We’ll be helping you out wherever you get stuck.

The end goal will be to merge your implementations into this repository inside the [submissions folder](./submissions/). If you’re not familiar with git don’t worry, we’ll guide you through it.
